# Quantum Mechanics

This repository contains code examples and explanations for quantum mechanics, which is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at a very small scale. The code examples are written in Python, and cover various topics in quantum mechanics such as:

- Wave-particle duality
- Quantum entanglement
- Schrödinger equation
- Uncertainty principle

## Requirements

To run the code examples in this repository, you will need to have the following Python packages installed:
